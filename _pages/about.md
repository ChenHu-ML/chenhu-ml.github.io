<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University, under the supervision of [Rui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ow1zCswAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My research focuses on geometric deep learning and matrix/vector manifolds (such as SPD, Grassmann, correlation, and hyperbolic manifolds), and their applications in brain-computer interfaces.

I am expected to graduate in June 2026 and am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities and research internships. If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me (chenhu-ml@163.com).
